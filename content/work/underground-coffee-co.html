blurb: "for underground coffee co, i was approached with modernizing their entire brand, from the logo to the website to
introducing them to social media. i approached this challenge with enthusiasm, immersing myself in the brand and truly
understanding what they wanted to convey to their customers. the end result was a complete transformation â€“ a new logo
and website that perfectly captured the essence of the brand, and video ad campaigns that helped to boost engagement and
bring the brand into the 21st century."
