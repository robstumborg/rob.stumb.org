blurb: "for underground coffee co, I was approached with modernizing their entire brand, from the logo to the website to
introducing them to social media. I approached this challenge with enthusiasm, immersing myself in their brand to truly
understand what they wanted to convey to their customers. the end result was a complete transformation â€“ a new logo
and website that perfectly captured the essence of the brand, and short video ad campaigns which resulted in high
engagement and brought the brand into the 21st century."
